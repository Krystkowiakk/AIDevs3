# AIDevs.pl Repository - Third Edition - Python Version

This repository contains the code and solutions for the third edition of the AIDevs program, designed to integrate Generative AI with application logic, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and advanced automation techniques to create autonomous AI Agents.

**Note**: The original AIDevs content is writen using JavaScript. This repository adapts all tasks and finds sollutions in Python, making it accessible to Python developers to follow the course objectives.

## Instructors

- **Adam Gospodarczyk** ([@overment](https://twitter.com/overment)) - Co-founder of EasyCart
- **Jakub Mrugalski** - Creator of UNKNOW NEWS, trainer at Niebezpiecznik.pl
- **Mateusz Chrobok** - Head of Fraud Intelligence at Nethone

## Getting Started

1. **Configure the `.env` File (use "save as dot env" File) **:
   - `AI_DEVS_API_KEY`: AIDevs API key.
   - `OPEN_AI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key.
   - ... and other task specific variables.

2. **Access Solutions**:
   - Solutions for AIDevs tasks are organized in `AIDevs3.ipynb` with the latest tasks at the top, and copies are also available in individual `.py` files for each task.

## Key Topics in the Third Edition

- **AI Agents**: Create autonomous systems that make decisions and access external data.
- **Multimodal AI**: Work with text, voice, and images to create richer applications.
- **Business Applications**: Apply AI for document processing, classification, and UI design.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Use external data sources to enhance AI responses.
